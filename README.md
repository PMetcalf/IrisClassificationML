# IrisClassificationML

Mini-machine learning Jupyter Notebook project focused on classification of iris dataset. Different scikit-learn classification models are trained on data, evaluated, and the leading model is used to make predictions on new data.

Models evaluated include:
1. Linear Regression
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis
3. K-Nearest Neighbors
4. Classification and Regression Trees
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes
6. Support Vector Machines

# Installation & Setup

The following Python packages are required to run this project:
1. jupyter (best installed with Anaconda)
2. matplotlib
3. numpy
4. pandas
5. scipy
6. sklearn

# Clone

Clone this repo using: https://github.com/PMetcalf/IrisClassificationML.git

# Uses

This project is primarily a sandbox to test and evaluate different, simple machine learning algorithms available in the scikit-learn package using a simple and well-understood data set.
